You can sell the things you made with the template, or sell changes you made to the template, but you cannot sell just the template or its components.  You may not sell, rent, lease, or transfer the compiled software, content, code, blueprints, and/or project files on a “stand-alone basis.” Derivative Commercial Projects must reasonably add value beyond the value of the Licensed Content (VR Template), and the Licensed Content must be merely a component of the Project and not the primary focus of the Project.

Except as otherwise prohibited (here or by Epic elsewhere), modify and distribute the software as you like.

VR Template includes the Unreal® Engine code and other code, materials, and information (the “Epic Materials”) from Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”). Any derivations of VR Template or Epic Materials must contain these licenses and must not contradict these licenses or incorporate material with incompatible licenses.

All Epic Materials are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, “with all faults” and without warranty of any kind. Inchoate Elk LLC, Epic, and Epic’s affiliates disclaim all warranties, conditions, common law duties, and representations (express, implied, oral, and written) with respect to the Epic Materials, including without limitation all express, implied, and statutory warranties and conditions of any kind, such as title, non-interference with your enjoyment, authority, non-infringement, merchantability, fitness or suitability for any purpose (whether or not Epic knows or has reason to know of any such purpose), system integration, accuracy or completeness, results, reasonable care, workmanlike effort, lack of negligence, and lack of viruses, whether alleged to arise under law, by reason of custom or usage in the trade, or by course of dealing.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Inchoate Elk LLC, Epic, and Epic’s affiliates make no warranty that (1) any of the Epic Materials will operate properly, including as integrated in VR Template, (2) that the Epic Materials will meet your requirements, (3) that the operation of the Epic Materials will be uninterrupted, bug free, or error free in any or all circumstances, (4) that any defects in the Epic Materials can or will be corrected, (5) that the Epic Materials are or will be in compliance with a platform manufacturer’s rules or requirements, or (6) that a platform manufacturer has approved or will approve VR Template, or will not revoke approval of VR Template for any or no reason. Any warranty against infringement that may be provided in Section 2-312 of the Uniform Commercial Code or in any other comparable statute is expressly disclaimed by Inchoate Elk LLC and Epic. Inchoate Elk LLC, Epic, and Epic’s affiliates do not guarantee continuous, error-free, virus-free, or secure operation of or access to the Epic Materials. This paragraph will apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither Inchoate Elk LLC, Epic, Epic’s licensors, nor its or their affiliates, nor any of Inchoate Elk LLC's or Epic’s service providers, shall be liable in any way for loss or damage of any kind resulting from the use or inability to use the Epic Materials or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure, or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. In no event will Inchoate Elk LLC, Epic, Epic’s licensors, nor its or their affiliates, nor any of Inchoate Elk LLC's or Epic’s service providers be liable for any loss of profits or any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, or any other damages arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Epic Materials, or the delay or inability to use or lack of functionality of the Epic Materials, even in the event of Inchoate Elk LLC's, Epic’s, or Epic’s affiliates’ fault, tort (including negligence), strict liability, indemnity, product liability, breach of contract, breach of warranty, or otherwise and even if Inchoate Elk LLC, Epic or Epic’s affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations and exclusions regarding damages apply even if any remedy fails to provide adequate compensation.

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, the liability of Inchoate Elk LLC, Epic, Epic’s licensors, its and their affiliates, and any of Inchoate Elk LLC's or Epic’s service providers shall be limited to the full extent permitted by law.
